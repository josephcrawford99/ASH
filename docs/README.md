# ASH - Architectural Site History

**Photo Key Documentation Made Simple**

ASH is an iOS application designed for architects, contractors, and historic preservation consultants who need to create professional photo keys for their projects. Document building conditions, map photo locations, and generate comprehensive visual records with ease.

## What is a Photo Key?

A photo key is a visual documentation tool that maps photographs to specific locations within a building or site. It allows stakeholders to quickly understand where each photo was taken by referencing numbered markers on a floor plan or site map. Photo keys are commonly used in:

- Historic preservation reports

- Construction documentation
- Architectural surveys
- Property inspections
