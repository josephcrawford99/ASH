# Privacy Policy

**ASH - Architectural Site History**

Last Updated: November 29, 2025

## Overview

ASH ("the App") is developed and maintained by Joseph Crawford ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. ASH is designed with a privacy-first approach, storing all data locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

When you use ASH, the following information is stored exclusively on your device:

- **Photos**: Images you import from your device's photo library
- **Photo Metadata**: EXIF data from your photos, including location coordinates and directional information
- **Floor Plans**: Images you upload as floor plan references
- **Photo Keys**: Project data including names, descriptions, and photo organization

### Data We Do Not Collect

ASH does not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers. Specifically:

- We do not collect personal information
- We do not use analytics or tracking services
- We do not share data with third parties
- We do not access your data remotely
- We do not use cookies or similar technologies

## Device Permissions

ASH requires the following device permissions to function:

- **Photo Library Access**: Required to import photos into your photo keys. Photos remain on your device and are not transmitted externally.
- **Location Services** (optional): Used only to display photo locations on maps. Location data is never transmitted off your device.

## Data Storage and Security

All data created within ASH is stored locally on your iOS device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including:

- Device passcode/biometric protection
- iOS data encryption
- App sandboxing

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can delete individual photo keys, photos, or floor plans at any time within the app. Uninstalling ASH will remove all app data from your device.

## Third-Party Services

ASH does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app uses Apple Maps for map display functionality, which is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.

## Children's Privacy

ASH does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The app is designed for professional use by architects, contractors, and preservation consultants.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
