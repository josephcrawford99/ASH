## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**How do I create a new photo key?**

Tap the "+" button on the main screen to create a new photo key. Enter a name for your project and you can begin adding photos immediately.

**How do I add photos to a photo key?**

Open a photo key and tap the "+" button to import photos from your device's photo library. You can select multiple photos at once.

**What photo formats are supported?**

ASH supports standard iOS photo formats including JPEG, PNG, and HEIC.

### Floor Plans

**How do I add a floor plan?**

Within a photo key, navigate to the floor plan section and tap to upload an image. You can then position and scale the floor plan to align with map coordinates.

**What file types work for floor plans?**

Any standard image format (JPEG, PNG) can be used as a floor plan.

### Maps and Location

**Why are my photos not showing on the map?**

Photos must contain location metadata (GPS coordinates) to appear on the map. Photos taken with location services disabled will not have this data.

**Can I manually set photo locations?**

Currently, ASH uses the embedded location data from your photos. Photos without GPS data will not appear on the map view.

### Data and Storage

**Where is my data stored?**

All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is uploaded to external servers.

**How do I back up my photo keys?**

Your photo key data is included in your standard iOS device backups through iCloud or iTunes/Finder.

**How do I delete a photo key?**

Swipe left on any photo key in the main list to reveal the delete option, or use the delete option within the photo key settings.

### Troubleshooting

**The app is running slowly**

Try closing and reopening the app. If issues persist, ensure your device has sufficient storage space available.

**Photos are not importing correctly**

Ensure you have granted ASH permission to access your photo library. You can check this in Settings > Privacy > Photos.
